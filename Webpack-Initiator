## Installing webpack
----------------------------------------------------------------
npm init -y
npm install  webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
 // create dist folder and move index there
// remove main and set privacy true in json file
npm install --save lodash



----------------------------------------------------------------

initialize it
install wbpack locally
(if you just want to use webpack only for bundling_)
npm install --save-dev web-pack , if you want to use webpack in production, ignore savedev, 

to install webpack-cli if you're using v4 or later, add -cli to be able to access it in cli
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli 

To run the local installation of webpack you can access its binary version as node_modules/.bin/webpack. Alternatively, if you are using npm v5.2.0 or greater, you can run npx webpack to do it.
